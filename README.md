## Why This Project
I have been involved in real estate in different capacities for over 10 years, and during the 4+ years of that time span I have acted in the capcacity of a Realtor, and the 7 years I have spent as a real estate investor, I have been increasingly disappointed by the lack of innovation in real estate technology. While this project is in no way going to reshape the MLS, I hope that it shows that, at least in a relatively simple way with limited functionality, that the digital tools for a Realtor, both in a digital marketing capacity as well as when listing properties for sale or rent, can be simple, useful and powerful.
