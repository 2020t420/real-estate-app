# Real Estate App
## Why This Project
I have been involved in real estate in different capacities for a while, and while I've spent the last few years building up my digital presence, I've never fully utlized a website as a hub for my online activity. While I do currently have a website for my work as a Realtor, I don't have a site that shows the rental properties I own and manage in my capacity as an investor, nor do I have a convenient way for potential tenants to inquire about a specific rental property or submit an application online. My current site is pretty bare bones and I'd like to have something that works as a landing page for my various real estate activities, as well as a digital hub to coordinate social media, blogging, an email newsletter, and client and tenant portals.
