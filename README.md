# Real Estate App
## Why This Project
I have been involved in real estate in different capacities for over 10 years, and during the 4+ years of that time span I have acted in the capcacity of a Realtor, and the 7 years I have spent as a real estate investor, I have been increasingly disappointed by the lack of innovation in real estate technology. While this project is in no way going to reshape the MLS, I hope that it shows that, at least in a relatively simple way with limited functionality, that the digital tools for a Realtor, both in a digital marketing capacity as well as when listing properties for sale or rent, can be simple, useful and powerful.

## Scope of Project
### Version 1
* Home Page includes links to Buyers, Sellers, Investors, Listings, Home Search, Rentals, Stay Informed and Austin Info pages as well as a collapsable bio
* Header/Footer on all pages includes social media connect buttons, contact info, required disclosures
* Admin Page allows site owner to login and launch the Dashboard
* Dashboard page allows user/owner to create/edit/remove listings and rental properties, manage photos, and toggle rental properties as either vacant or occupied
* Buyer and Investor pages provide some static content and "useful links" but also incorporate a mortage calculator
* Seller page provide static content
* Austin Info page provides "useful links"
* Stay Informed page allows site visitor to sign up for an email newsletter and automatically be added via MailChimp, view newsletter archives, and link to a separate online newsletter
* Listings will populate from the listings created in the Dashboard; clicking on a listing will open up a detailed version of that listing; clicking on photos will open up a slideshow-type photo viewer with larger photos
* Rentals will populate from the rentals created in the Dashboard and display whether or not they are available for rent (and specific date that they will become available); will contain same detailed & photo-viewing funcitionality as Listings; will have downloadable applications
